# espanso_gui

Espanso GUI is my attempt at a graphical user interface for the text expander Espanso. The goal is to make something simple enough that it can be used by anyone who is able to use a computer. I am not a professional developer, do not now git well, and my focus is on development. I won't be expanding on the documentation so requesting it as of now is pointless, if you like the project and like to contribute please to so using issues, or fork it and work on it yourself if you want to. I will however not answer pull requests as of now.
